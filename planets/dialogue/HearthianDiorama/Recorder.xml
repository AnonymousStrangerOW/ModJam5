			<Page>The Hearthian legend Feldspar has made several grand endeavors.</Page>
			<Page>We've seen their ship bounce from planet to planet, so much so that we've started theorizing how their adventures even went.</Page>
			<Page>Xenon got particularly motivated to write stories about them. In one instance, they descend into Brittle Hollow with no way out.</Page>
			<Page>But good ol' Feldspar, they always find a way. They snagged a nearby Nomai tractor beam from one of the ruins and positioned themselves under a hole in the crust above.</Page>
			<Page>They put the frame down, pointed their trusted flashlight at a light sensor in a nearby observatory, then let the tractor beam push them back to the surface.</Page>
			<Page>Sometimes we Karvi wonder if they actually did things like these.</Page>
