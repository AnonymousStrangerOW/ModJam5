			<Page>The Hearthian legend Feldspar has made several grand endeavors.</Page>
			<Page>We've seen their ship bounce from planet to planet, so much so that we've started theorizing how his adventures even went.</Page>
			<Page>One of our curators made a story based off of Feldspar's stories, where they descend into Brittle Hollow, with no way out.</Page>
			<Page>But good ol' Feldspar, they always find a way. They snagged a nearby Nomai Tractor Beam from one of the ruins and positioned themselves under a hole in the crust above.</Page>
			<Page>Once in the right spot, they placed it down and let the tractor beams push them back to the surface.</Page>
			<Page>Sometimes we Karvi wonder if Feldspar actually did things like these.</Page>
