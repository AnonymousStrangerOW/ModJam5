		<Text>TIN: Therefore, it is possible to influence the possibilities of a quantum object by simply blocking these sockets with <![CDATA[<color=orange>non-quantum items</color>]]>.</Text>

		<Text>TIN: Indeed. Under some conditions, a quantum object can fail to collapse into a state and all its sockets will remain briefly empty. However, the object can obtain another possible state that is so improbable by quantum laws that the object "refuses" to collapse there, unless manipulated by the fourth quantum rule.</Text>
